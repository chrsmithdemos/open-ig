    * **New:** Computer voice is fun but only for a few hours. After that, it becomes annoying. However, it is still useful if the computer reports a production or research to be completed or warns about an enemy fleet. Therefore, you may disable the screen switch commentary and notifications separately.

  * Colonize an empty planet: build a colony ship and approach an empty planet. Note that some enemy planets may appear empty if you don't have them in a range of a v2.0 radar.
  * Load and Save screen added. You may now load any previous saves. Saving is just simply adding a new save with the current time, similarly to CTRL+S. Note that the Settings view is not implemented.
    * You may now return to the Main menu to start a new game instead of relaunching the application
  * The old setup screen is now hidden. Will be replaced by the new ingame Settings screen mentioned before.
