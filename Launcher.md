# Introduction #

Many game feature a so-called Launcher program: it lets you install, repair, upgrade and launch the game and any associated programs such as editors or video viewers.

The manual upgrade process of the Open Imperium Galactica can become tedious, therefore, a new Launcher program is created to automate the process as much as possible.

Users need only to download and use the latest **open-ig-launcher.jar** file. It will take care of upgrading itself, the main game, the map editor and video player automatically - with your approval of course.
