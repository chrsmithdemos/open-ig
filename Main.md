# Introduction #
Open-IG is an open source Java<sup>TM</sup> clone of the [Digital Reality](http://www.digitalreality.hu) game [Imperium Galactica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperium_Galactica), a popular real time space strategy game developed around 1997 in Hungary. Open-IG attempts to mimic the original game as closely as possible while extending it with new features. It needs the original Imperium Galactica files to run.

Open-IG is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

Some teaser images can be found on the [screenshots](http://code.google.com/p/open-ig/wiki/Screenshots) page.

# Installation #

  1. Install Java JRE/JDK 1.6.X (preferrably X >= 10) or later.
  1. Copy the contents of the original Imperium Galactica CD1 and CD2 into one directory (duplicate files can be simply overwritten).
  1. Put the ` open-ig-0.72.jar ` file into that directory. Note that the application requires at least 160 MB of memory. You can use the -Xmx command line parameter or change the .jar file extension assignment settings in your operating system to include it.
  1. To run the game double click on this file or use the command line

` java -Xmx160M -jar open-ig-0.72.jar `

> If you don't want to put the JAR with the game files, you could use an extra command line parameter to specify the home of the IG files (the path might be case sensitive on your operating system):

` java -Xmx160M -jar open-ig-0.72.jar c:\games\ig\ `

Java 1.6u10 thru 1.6u14 seems to have some performance issues with the newly introduced D3D pipeline, causing the game to consume lots of CPU resources and rendering becomes slow. In this case, you could run the program with the ` -Dsun.java2d.d3d=false ` command line parameter and everything should be fast again. My experience is that running the game on JDK7 does not suffer this performance problem but runs even faster with lower CPU consumption.

On Windows you can change the default memory allocated for a Java program run from a JAR file by browsing to the ` HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\jarfile\shell\open\command\(default) ` key in **Regedit** and set it to

` "C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin\javaw.exe" -Xmx256M -jar "%1" %* `

by adding the ` -Xmx256M ` before the ` -jar ` parameter.

Please see this page later on or the [documentation](Documentation.md) page for what can you do within the application at the moment.

## Differences from the original game ##
Apart from the tons of missing screens and behaviors, there are few deliberate changes:
  * Starmap and planet screens are occupying the entire window, the rest are centered and shadow out the big screens behind them. The original game was constrained to 640x480.
  * Scrolling the starmap and planet is done using right-mouse pan. In the original game, you had to hold the right mouse button near the edges of the view to scroll it. I think this is a bit cumbersome for a modern UI game.
  * Zoom is done with CTRL+Mouse Wheel. You can also left/right click on the zoom button to zoom in/out. The original game, you could click on the zoom button, or switch to zoom mode and click on the starmap. This is understandable, as in 1996 there were not many mouses with scroll wheel.

# Development #

Currently, not much info can I provide.

## Developer resources ##

  * [PAC file format](PAC_Format.md) specification
  * [ANI file format](ANI_Format.md) specification
  * [LZSS decompression algorithm](Custom_LZSS.md) used in the ANI files
  * [RLE decompression algorithm](Custom_RLE.md) used in the ANI files
  * [Surface map files](Surface_Maps.md)

# Tools #

The Open-IG will play the original game's ANI files. To play these files separately, please use the [AnimPlay](http://open-ig.googlecode.com/files/animplay-0.55.jar) utility. Double click on this file or use the command line ` java -jar animplay-0.55.jar `. The utility will allow you to select a file to play. You can find more info on the AnimPlay page.
(The source code is available from the SVN.)

## External tools ##

There exist an unpacker for the game PAC files. You can downoad it from [here](http://bgafc.t-hosting.hu/data/ig1pac_h.exe).
